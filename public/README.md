# Advocate and Emulate
#### Written in HTML, CSS and JQuery. Also utilizing bootstrap for styling.

Advocate and Emulate is a website that was designed in order to facilitate the protection of wild animals. We emulate and copy and covet products that remind us of animals. But it's rare that those purchases actually serve to protect any of the animals we have so much love for. People buy things that emulate wild endangered animals all the time without thinking about how those same animals will not exist for the next generation. We buy stuffed teddybears for kids without thinking to donate for the protection of that animal. We buy shoes/coats/gloves/etc that are leopard print without thinking to advocate for the leopard. I think part of this is that our current purchase model doesn't do enough to highlight those brands that are donating to a cause. Hopefully Advocate and Emulate can fill that gap.

This website hits the shopstyle api to mine for current products that users can purchase where a portion of the proceeds is donated to the cause of protecting wild and endangered animals.
