# g29-Q1-project-proposals

### Students should submit a pull request with an updated README that outlines their project idea

### Your README should include the following:

1. A brief description of your project
2. What technologies do you plan to use (just list them)
3. What will your MVP be?
4. What features will you add if you have time (Nice to haves...)?

EXAMPLE:
```
Description:
The website is called Advocate and Emulate.
The challenge: People buy things that emulate wild endangered animals, without thinking about how those same animals will not exist for the next generation. We buy stuffed teddybears for kids without thinking to donate for the protection of that animal. We buy shoes/coats/gloves/etc that are leopard print without thinking to advocate for the leopard.

This website is going to hit the instagram api to mine for current images that emulate an endangered animal and the NatureServe api which will give stats on that animal and how many of that animal are left in the world.

It will have links on how to become a partner organization with the WWF and it will have links to companies/products that are already affiliated/helping the World Wildlife Fund to encourage more responsible purchasing/advocating.

Technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery

MVP:
Match an instagram photo up with animal stats and display both side by side. Then display a way to advocate for that animal.
