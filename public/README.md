Description:
The website is called Advocate and Emulate.
The challenge: People buy things that emulate wild endangered animals, without thinking about how those same animals will not exist for the next generation. We buy stuffed teddybears for kids without thinking to donate for the protection of that animal. We buy shoes/coats/gloves/etc that are leopard print without thinking to advocate for the leopard.

This website hits the shopstyle api to mine for current products that users can purchase where a portion of the proceeds is donated to the cause of protecting wild and endangered animals
