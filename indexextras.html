              There are teddybears and giraffe teething toys for children. There are greeting cards with bears on them. We purchase coats or shoes with leopard print or snake prints. But how often do we emulate and advocate for a wild animal?



              If you spend a dollar emulating an animal, please think to also spend a portion of your time or money also advocating for that animal. This website

              everydayare emulating animals without honoring them. We buy our children teddybears without advocating for the wild bear. We wear leopard print without advocating for the leopard. We buy costumes, sleepwear, shoes, dresses, toys, furniture, wallpaper, candy and more that is shaped like, or in some other way reflects wild animals.

              We know that soon many of these animals will be extinct, but We teach our kids what a bear or a tiger sounds like from the youngest age. One of the most popular teething toys in the US is in the shape of a giraffe.

              We love wild animals and we will purchase products to showcase their presence or beauty in our home. But the majority of these products do not come with a way to advocate for the very creatures that we emulate.</p>
